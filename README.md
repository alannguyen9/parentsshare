# Introduction
+**Researcher**: Quoc Anh Nguyen, a student of MSc Software Development study programme, University of Strathclyde, email: nguyen-quoc-anh.2023@uni.strath.ac.uk

+**Supervisor**: Dr. Alasdair Lambert, Teaching Associate, University of Strathclyde, email: alasdair.lambert@strath.ac.uk.

## What is the purpose of this research?
After gathering information on parents’ opinions of sharing resources for supervising their children when they play together, the researcher **develops a mobile application for a graduation project (CS958)**. Although parents want to spend their time playing with their children as much as possible, sometimes their kids still want to have other friends to play with. A group of children playing together can help them develop their social skills. Parents can also save time and resources by alternatively changing their supervision role via the application.  

### In the research, three surveys are conducted:

+**An online survey (above-mentioned questionnaires)**: The questionnaire will help the researcher gather technical requirements and identify the features of the application properly to meet potential users' demands in the future. 
Participants conduct an online survey using the **Qualtrics Form** tool with the student email of University of Strathclyde (up to 60 people).

+**A face-to-face interview (questionnaires)**: This interview aims to enhance the application's usability and functionality to better serve users' needs.
Each participant has a **FACE-TO-FACE interview via ZOOM** (up to 5 people).

+**Tests (User Acceptance tests and/or End-to-End Tests)**: Face-to-face observation and discussion between a user and the developer when a user behaves a real device.
Each participant has a **FACE-TO-FACE trial session** on a **real device** and discussion (up to 3 people)

### Title of the study:
 Mobile application to provide location-based information for parents/carers to share resources in terms of caring for and educating their children.

# Parents share resources application


This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app — you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

## Step 3: Modifying your App

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's modify it.

1. Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and edit some lines.
2. For **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Developer Menu** (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on Window and Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on macOS)) to see your changes!

   For **iOS**: Hit <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> in your iOS Simulator to reload the app and see your changes!

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:
